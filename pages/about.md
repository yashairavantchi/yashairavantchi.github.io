description: Yasha Iravantchi is a Design Specialist at Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs
---

I am a Design Specialist at the 
[Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/active-learning-labs)

I graduated from Harvard University in 2014 with an SB degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering/Computer Science.

Since graduation, I started working at the Harvard Active Learning Labs as a Design Specialist, supporting courses that involve hands-on labs and projects. In addition, I create workshops to instruct "Design Thinking". Most recently, I was a Teaching Fellow for ES 155 (Biological Signal Processing) and lab and fabrication support for ES 151 (Applied Electromagnetics). Please see my "Teaching" and "Talks" pages for more information.

I'm interested in a wide varitey of projects, but I have a particular interested in fabrication, wearables, ubiquitous computing, and biological signal processing. My advisor was Krzysztof Gajos and my senior project was "Robust Eye Blink--Based Selection Technique for Gaze-Based Interaction". Please see my "Projects" and "Publications" pages for more information.
