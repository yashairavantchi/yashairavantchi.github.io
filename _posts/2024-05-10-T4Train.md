Pairing real-time ML with sensor data drives many interactive applications. However, the tools to prototype these applications are often proprietary and not open-source. This course instructs how to build interactive sensing applications using T4Train, an open-source and user-friendly framework for rapid prototyping. Participants will learn sensor interfaces (e.g., on a laptop/Arduino), signal processing, ML, and the T4Train tool. Afterward, they will build real-time, interactive sensing systems, such as LED lighting that reacts to different sounds or hand movements. This course builds on 4 semesters of instruction using T4Train and multiple HCI research contributions, including 3 award-winning papers at CHI.
