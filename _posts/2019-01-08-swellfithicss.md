Peripheral edema is a swelling of the legs, feet, or handsdue to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissues.For   patients   with somechronic   diseases, peripheral  edemais  a  crucial  indicator  of  onset  or exacerbation  of  thecondition.  Thus,  early  detection  of peripheral  edema  isimportant  for  timely  diagnosis  of associated  diseases.However, existingtechniquesfor edema  assessment area  subjective  measurement  for which   a human   operatorestimatesthe   amount   of swelling  using  a  tape  measure  orbypressing  theswollen  areawith  the  tip  of an  index  finger.  As  a systematic approach to assessingperipheral edema, we develop SwellFit, an experimentalprototype of a novel wearable  technology  that  monitorsperipheral  edema by  tracking  changes  in  ankle  curvature.Through a series of proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstratethat   SwellFit   detects   ankle   swelling   even   in   the presence   of   substantial   noise   in   the   raw   sensorreadings.
