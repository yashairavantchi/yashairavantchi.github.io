Today, I decided it was finally tyme to update my Jekyll site hosted on github.io. What should have taken 2 minutes took a whole day thanks to some Ruby/MacOS Sierra/Jekyll issues. Turns out for whatever reason Ruby 2.4.0 on MacOS Sierra does not play nice with Jekyll. Something about a JSON 1.8.2 gem not installing properly. 

Anyways, it's finally done. Phew!
