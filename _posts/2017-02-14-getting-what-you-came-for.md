I recently came accross [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-What-You-Came-Students/dp/0374524777) from one of my Grad School Admit emails. While I haven't gotten the chance to read it yet, it seems like there are [many](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgs/documents/HowtoSurviveGradSchool_JM8_24_15.pdf), [many](http://jodischneider.com/slides/nuig-induction-day-2010-10-21.pdf), [many](https://grad.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/The-University-of-Michigans-Guide-for-Graduate-Students.pdf) resources that sum up the gist of the book.
