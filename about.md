Hello!

I am a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon](https://cmu.edu/). 

Prior to joining CMU, I graduated from [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu) in 2014 with an S.B. degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I worked at the 
[Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/active-learning-labs) as a Design Specialist in Electrical Engineering. 

My research focus is on novel user interfaces and interaction, wearables, ubiquitous computing, and biological signal processing. Please see my ["Academics"]({{ BASE_PATH }}/academics/) page for more information.
