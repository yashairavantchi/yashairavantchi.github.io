Hello!

Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the [Human-Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie Mellon](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/)

I graduated from Harvard University in 2014 with an SB degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering.

Since undergrad, I worked at the 
[Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/active-learning-labs) as a Design Specialist in Electrical Engineering, supporting courses that involve hands-on labs and projects. In addition, I create workshops to instruct "Design Thinking". Additionally, I advised students in their Senior Capstone Project and was a Teaching Fellow for our biosignal processing course. Please see my ["Teaching"](http://yasha.xyz/academics/teaching/) and ["Talks"](http://yasha.xyz/academics/talks/) pages for more information.

I'm interested in a wide varitey of projects, but I have a particular interested in fabrication, wearables, ubiquitous computing, and biological signal processing. Please see my ["Projects"](http://yasha.xyz/academics/projects/) and ["Research"](http://yasha.xyz/academics/research/) pages for more information.
