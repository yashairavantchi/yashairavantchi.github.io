Hello!

I am a CSE Ph.D. student at [University of Michigan EECS](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/) and a [2022 Meta PhD Research Fellow](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2022/2/announcing-the-recipients-of-the-2022-meta-phd-research-fellowship/). I am advised by [Alanson Sample](http://www.alansonsample.com/). 

I graduated from [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu) in 2014 with an S.B. degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. I worked at the 
[Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/active-learning-labs) as a Design Specialist in Electrical Engineering. 

My research focus is on solving the challenges of continuous remote health monitoring and activity inferencing by developing novel sensing hardware and privacy-preserved sensing approaches. Please see my CV below for more information.
