Hello there!

I am a CSE Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Michigan EECS](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/). I am advised by [Alanson Sample](http://www.alansonsample.com/). My research has been supported by the [2022 Meta PhD Research Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2022/2/announcing-the-recipients-of-the-2022-meta-phd-research-fellowship/) and the [2024 Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/yasha-iravantchi-receives-rackham-predoctoral-fellowship).

My research focuses on solving the challenges of continuous remote health monitoring and activity inferencing by developing novel sensing hardware and privacy-preserved sensing approaches. Please see my CV below for more information. 

Prior to the University of Michigan, I graduated from [Harvard College](https://college.harvard.edu) in 2014 with an S.B. degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Electrical Engineering/Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering. Afterwards, I worked at the 
[Harvard University SEAS Active Learning Labs](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/active-learning-labs) as a Design Specialist in Electrical Engineering, where I developed hands-on EE curriculum and supported students in hardware design. Most notably, I assisted in the development of a new course on wearable signal processing, which was featured at SciPyCon 2016.
