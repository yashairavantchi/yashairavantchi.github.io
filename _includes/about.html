                <p>Hello! I am an Electrical Engineer interested in seamlessly interfacing software and hardware. I graduated from Harvard University in 2014 with an SB degree in Engineering Sciences with a focus on Biomedical Engineering and Electrical Engineering/Computer Science.
                </p> 
                <p>
                I'm interested in a wide varitey of projects, but I have a particular interested in fabrication, wearables, ubiquitous computing, and signal processing with a focus on biosignals. My advisor was K Gajos and my senior project was "Robust Eye Blink--Based Selection Technique for Gaze-Based Interaction". Please see my "Projects/Research" page for more information. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Since graduating, I started working at the Harvard Active Learning Labs as a Design Specialist, supporting courses that involve hands-on labs and projects. Most recently, I helped supprort ES 155 (Biological Signal Processing) and ES 151 (Applied Electromagnetics). Please see my "Teaching" page for more information.
